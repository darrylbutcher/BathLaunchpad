## What was Launchpad
LaunchPad was a 24 hour Hackathon at Bath University where we had 23 hours (Blame daylight saving) to create and launch an idea. 

## Description:
This is a prototype of an app to conveniently link people with short time jobs with flexible uni students.
Developed in android studio with SQL Lite database integration.

## Buisness Presentation
The other members in our group produced a buisness model of how this idea could grow and be made into a buisness.
